All the analyses below are established on the assumption that the significance level is 0.05. 


## 1. Linear Regression to Predict MPG

 - Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
   - After conducting the multiple linear regression analysis on the dataset, the P-values of all independent variables were obtained. The P-values of vehicle_length and ground_clearance are smaller than the significance level we defined (0.05). Therefore, it can be concluded that vehicle_length and ground_clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. The results are shown in the images below.
